# Getting Started with Git

Git is a popular version control system used by software engineers around the world. It's primary purpose is to maintain different versions of files, and to allow multiple engineers to work on the same thing at once.

Git was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), who was the main author of the [Linux Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Kernel), the base of many modern operating systems (including every linux distribution, and Andorid). When he was working on the kernel with others, he ran into issues with collaboration (think emailing code back and forth). He wrote git as a solution.
